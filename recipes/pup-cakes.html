    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>These are nice cupcake treats for dogs that I made up for my dog Presley's 4th birthday. They are perfect for dogs with food allergies. Warning: they don't look pretty, but Fido will love them! These freeze well, and you can zap them in the microwave for a nice, occasional dog snack.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium apple - peeled, cored and shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup applesauce</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>  
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Mix together apple, cheese, applesauce, eggs and olive oil in a bowl. Combine whole wheat flour, oats, and baking powder in a separate bowl; stir by hand into the wet ingredients until well blended. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops of the muffins spring back when lightly pressed. Cool completely before serving.</li>    
      </ol>
